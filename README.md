## HARRY JIAWEI HU üëãüòÅ

üì¢ The goal of this lab is to develop familiarity with front-end web development by creating our own personal website. To start, we clone the public repo from https://github.com/varadbhogayata/varadbhogayata.github.io as our reference. The code there will help guide us as a starting point.
